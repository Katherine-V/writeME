#writeME
##
The objective of this design is to provide a simple and straightforward application to support those who might draft many readme files as part of their vocation.
<br>
##
How to use:
<br>
The function is met by accessing the application via the command line, which is accessible by use of windows' Terminal or the quite useful GitBash.
<br>
Prompts will direct the user to enter specific information that can then fill out the template to make a new ReadMe file.
<br>
This video illustrates the function, but ends on a technical difficulty.<br>
